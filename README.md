# Working with Dynamic Content and Templating Engines in NodeJS

This repo is based on M Schwarzmuller NodeJS course on Udemy, Section 6.

The focus is on replacing static data in an html page with dynamically-generated data. No database is involved in this project, but will in later projects. Here, the goal is to work with dummy data to dynamically generate output, and work with templating engines.

Three different templating engines will be used, and each have their own branch: Pug, Handlebars, and EJS. The master project timeline will ultimately use the EJS templating engine, but a branch for each of the two other methods are created but unincorporated into the master branch.
